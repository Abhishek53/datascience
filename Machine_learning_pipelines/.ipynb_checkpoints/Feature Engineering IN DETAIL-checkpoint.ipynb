    "##### Missing Completely at Random, MCAR: A variable is missing completely at random (MCAR) if the probability of being missing is the same for all the observations. When data is MCAR, there is absolutely no relationship between the data missing and any other values, observed or missing, within the dataset. In other words, those missing data points are a random subset of the data. There is nothing systematic going on that makes some data more likely to be missing than other.\n",
